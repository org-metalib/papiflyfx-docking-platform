- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implements new dockable content types and application features.
  - Integrates PapiflyFX framework components into the application.
  - Follows JavaFX best practices (programmatic UI, no FXML).

${h3} 2. Build & Runtime Engineer (@ops-engineer)

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages the Maven build and dependency versions.
  - Ensures all modules compile and tests pass in headless mode.
  - Maintains CI/CD workflows and release readiness.
- **Focus Area**: Root `pom.xml`, `.github/workflows/`.

- Follow the spec-first workflow for non-trivial work: research, plan, implement, validate.
- Use `spec/agents/README.md` as the shared operating protocol.

${h2} Review Gates

- Changes to build logic or dependencies require `@ops-engineer` review.
