# PapiflyFX Docking Agent Session Prompts

This file provides copy-paste prompts for starting Claude or Codex sessions as a specific repository agent. Use these prompts with [README.md](README.md), [playbook.md](playbook.md), [cheatsheet.md](cheatsheet.md), and the role files in this directory.

## How To Use

1. Open a fresh Claude or Codex session for one agent only.
2. Copy the prompt for the lead or reviewer role you need.
3. Replace the placeholders before sending.
4. If the task is already underway, append the latest handoff block and any relevant `plan.md`, `progress.md`, or `validation.md` paths.
5. Keep one session per agent per task unless you are explicitly branching work.

## Common Placeholders

- `<task>`: the user request in repository terms.
- `<priority>`: `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, or `P3`.
- `<impacted-modules>`: Maven modules or spec directories expected to change.
- `<required-reviewers>`: reviewers already chosen by intake.
- `<key-invariants>`: behaviors or contracts that must not break.
- `<acceptance-criteria>`: what must be true for the task to be done.
- `<validation-expectations>`: automated checks and manual checks to run.
- `<spec-paths>`: task-specific spec files or module README files to read first.
- `<change-summary>`: short summary of the implementation being reviewed.
- `<files-or-paths>`: paths touched or under review.

## Shared Context Block

Add this near the top of any prompt when you want to force context loading in a fresh session:

```text
Read these first:
- AGENTS.md
- spec/agents/README.md
- spec/agents/playbook.md
- spec/agents/<role>.md
- <spec-paths>

Follow the repository's single-lead model, review gates, spec-first workflow, and handoff contract.
```

## `@spec-steward`

### Intake Prompt

```text
As @spec-steward, intake this PapiflyFX Docking task.

Read these first:
- AGENTS.md
- spec/agents/README.md
- spec/agents/playbook.md

1. Priority (`P0`-`P3`)
2. Recommended lead agent
3. Required reviewers
4. Impacted modules and spec/docs paths

6. Whether this should use the fast path or full spec-first workflow
7. Required artifacts (`research.md`, `plan.md`, `progress.md`, `validation.md`, README updates)
8. Suggested validation strategy
9. A short handoff block for the lead agent
```

### Closure Prompt

```text
As @spec-steward, close this PapiflyFX Docking task against the repository definition of done.

Read these first:
- AGENTS.md
- spec/agents/README.md
- spec/agents/playbook.md
- spec/agents/spec-steward.md
- <spec-paths>

Task:
<task>

Implementation summary:
<change-summary>

<validation-expectations>

Updated docs/specs:
<files-or-paths>

Open risks:

## `@core-architect`

### Lead Prompt

```text
As @core-architect, lead this PapiflyFX Docking core task.

Read these first:
- AGENTS.md
- spec/agents/README.md
- spec/agents/playbook.md
- spec/agents/core-architect.md
- <spec-paths>

Task:
<task>

Priority:
<priority>

Impacted modules:

Validation expectations:
<validation-expectations>

Instructions:
- Treat `papiflyfx-docking-api` and `papiflyfx-docking-docks` as the primary ownership boundary.
- Check whether existing extension points can solve the task before widening shared contracts.
- For API and SPI design, prefer the clearest contract for the current version. Do not add compatibility shims, deprecated overloads, or legacy behavior unless the task explicitly requires backward compatibility.
- If `DockManager`, layout models, or session persistence change, call out compatibility and restore risks explicitly.
- If implementation is appropriate, make the change and close with the repository handoff contract.

Return:
1. Proposed approach
2. Risks and invariants
3. Required spec/doc updates
4. Validation performed or planned
5. Final handoff block
```
